# Orderbot
This Orderbot is used to automatically fill out order forms to buy new robots

I have created a python executable file that uses a GUI for user input. The first field requires the link to the .csv data while the second field requires the link to the order form.

I have only designed the code to run on Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.

Once all the data is entered you can hit the green button to start the robot.

The .pdf receipts will be zipped and stored in the Output folder.

The two links that are to be used for this robot are as follows:

CSV Link: 
    https://robotsparebinindustries.com/orders.csv
    
Order Form Link:
    https://robotsparebinindustries.com/#/robot-order
